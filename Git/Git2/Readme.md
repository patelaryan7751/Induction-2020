## Hey Guys! Welcome Back.

This is Day 2 and we are back with a yet another simple, yet educative exercise.<br>
<br>
Well, you all did a great job in task 1. I hope that you guys got the feels of how open source community works, how collab works.<br>
But one obvious problem that arise with such collaberation is Inconsistency of version.<br>
well, what I mean to say is, all of you forked the same repository. But, with every new commit into the repo, the master repo changed a little. That might not be the case for your version of the repo that you forked. It would have gone out of sync with the master.<br>
Such a problem is common when a group of devs work on a single project. Everybody tend to change the bit they are assigned and atlast everybody ends up with a master repo that contains changes made from all the devs and the forked repos dont get updated.<br>
<br>
Well! how to solve it then? How to update our forked repo to the master?<br>
<br>
This is what you guys have to figure out today in todays [task](https://github.com/EnigmaVSSUT/Induction-2020/blob/master/Git2/Instructions.md).<br>
<br>

P.S. iF you have absolutely no idea where to begin, follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhwBgYPfoVE).
But i highly recommend doing your own research before going into the link above, it always makes you a better coder when u decide to solve your problems yourself. ATB.
