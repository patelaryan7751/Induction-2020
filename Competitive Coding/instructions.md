This will be a one week training and practice session of Competitive Coding. 

We will be teaching you the basics of Competitive Programming, why it is so important, how do we start with it, what are the problems
and errors faced and how to proceed further. 

Beginning with very simple and classic Competitive Coding questions, we will move on to solving higher difficulty level problems and 
explaining some much required concepts on the way.

You will be learning how to tackle the problem statements, to think in a logical way, to overcome certain mistakes that all programmers face 
in the beginning and to develop a habit of practicing competitive coding. At the same time, we will be giving you small tasks to test your
knowledge and understanding. You will be judged on the basis of your performance in the tasks. 

The daily tasks and resources will be uploaded in the respective folders. Make sure you go through all the links given in the resources and 
practice a lot to make the best out of your learning.

At the end of the week, we will be taking a competitive coding competition with intermediate level questions and your score in this 
competition will be marked. 

Happy learning! :)
