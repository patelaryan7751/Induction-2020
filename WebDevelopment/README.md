<b>Hello and welcome to Week 2!</b><br>
So, you’ve ventured into competitive coding and learnt how to work with shared code through Open Source. Well done, but you still have a lot to learn, young Padawan. Your next task will be to venture into the murkier waters of the gigantic worldwide network called the Internet. Welcome to Web Development.<br>
Q.<b> What is Web Development?</b><br>
Since its beginnings at the end of the 20th century, the internet has grown exponentially. In the modern world, pretty much everyone has internet access of some form and a huge percentage of people use the internet every single day. Web development is quickly becoming one of the most attractive and best-paid career choices in the modern world. <br>
Web development refers to the building of web pages and websites that go on the World Wide Web. Every website is built through intricate lines of code, which you can inspect yourself on your browser. Now that you know what you are up against, let’s go into the basics of what a website is made up of.<br><br>

Q.<b> How is a web page structured?</b><br>
There are two sides to a web page: Front-End and Back-End.<br>
Front End Development: The part of a website that user interacts with directly is termed as front end. It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the languages used for Front End development.<br>
Backend Development: Backend is server side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users.<br>
In essentiality, Frontend and backend development are quite different from each other, but still, they are two aspects of the same situation. The frontend is what users see and interact with and backend is how everything works. <br>
For the time being, we shall work with the Front-End part only.<br><br>

Q. <b>What do you require for Web Development?</b><br>
First up, you will need a code editor, or where you shall actually write the code for the website. The most convenient code editor, is Visual Studio Code. However, if you are comfortable using other code editors, such as Sublime or Atom, that works perfectly fine as well.<br><br>

<b>You can download VSCode at</b>: https://code.visualstudio.com/download<br><br>

Furthermore, make sure you install the live server extension, which is a very handy extension in order to monitor the changes you have made in the website in real-time. It can be found under “Marketplace” in VSCode.<br><br>

Next, to wade through the murky waters of Web Development, you’ll need knowledge in tools. Namely, HTML and CSS.<br>
●	HTML: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text documentation within tag which defines the structure of web pages.<br>
●	CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.<br><br>
